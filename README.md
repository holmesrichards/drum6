Ridiculous bending and repurposing of First Act drum pad as Eurorack module and maybe controller

I paid $5 at a thrift store for a First Act Discovery Monsta Jam Digital Drum Pad toy. I'm working on bending it and repurposing its guts as a Eurorack module, and I might turn the externals into a synth controller too.

The main board allows generating six predefined drum sounds. These will be triggerable in the module. The speed/pitch also turns out to be voltage controllable, so there'll be a CV input for that. Annoyingly, it times itself out after a certain amount of inactivity, and this doesn't seem to be preventable. But I plan to add a circuit to poke it awake again every time it drifts off, kind of like you do when your grandfather is driving.

The obnoxious canned rhythms will not be made available.

This will be the sort of drum module no one wants, but it'll be fun making it.

Meanwhile the externals, including the pads themselves and the associated switches, are usable and might become a trigger/gate generating controller.
