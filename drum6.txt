First Act pinout

Numbers in first column are pins on added header

 1 REST  ON pulls this pin to ground
   P10   TEMPO
   P11   RHY-VOL
   P12   DRUM-VOL
 2 P13   RHY1-3SEL right side of switch
   VDD   
   P20   RHY1-3SEL left side of switch
   P21   OFF
 4 P23   DEMO/PLAY   0V play, 4.2V demo
 5 P30   R7 pad
 6 P31   R10 pad
 7 P32   R11 pad
 8 P33   R14 pad
 9 P40   R13 pad
10 P41   R12 pad
   P42   N/C has 4.2V when system on, 0V when off
12 P43   ? has 0.27V when system on, 4.2V when off
   VDD   4.2V
13 V01A  Audio out
   VSS   0V

14 	 VCC (on end of speed resistor)
15	 Speed control pin (on other end of speed resistor)

Gate (~4.5V) on pins P10-13, P21, P30-33, P40-41 triggers action.
DEMO/PLAY switch affects system timeout: 15 sec for DEMO, 3 min for PLAY.

56k THT resistor on processor board governs speed/pitch. Appears to be
input for an internal current-controlled oscillator. Change resistance or
voltage (it was connected to VCC) and speed/pitch changes.

Current (hence speed) can go down to zero with no ill effects, up to
about 5V with 27k resistor. So we can take 0â€“5V control voltages
(enforce that range after provided attenuator).

Best? idea so far for timeout workaround:

Differentiate P42 to produce a pulse when system shuts off. Pulse turns on 
a transistor connecting REST to ground. Pulse length must be long enough to
initiate reset, not so long as to leave the system off too long.

Or if producing the negative pulse isn't working, use P43 to turn on a
transistor connecting a 555 astable to the REST-ground transistor.
